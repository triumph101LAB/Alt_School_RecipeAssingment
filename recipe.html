    <h2> Tips</h2>
    
    <p> 
        Baking a cake is a rewarding but straightforward process. 
        Start with a clean workspace, gather your ingredients, and preheat the oven. Cream butter and sugar until pale, then add eggs and flavorings. Alternate adding dry ingredients and wet components, being careful not to overmix. Pour the batter into a prepared pan and bake until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cake cool completely before frosting or layering, and enjoy the result of your careful prep and patience. 
        If youâ€™d like a tailored recipe, tell me your flavor, pan size, and any dietary needs.
